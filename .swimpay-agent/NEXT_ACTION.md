## Latest Frontend Work

Buyer checkout UX realignment is complete.

Completed:

1. Created tasks 399 through 406 and updated the task queue.
2. Created `.swimpay-agent/BUYER_CHECKOUT_SCREEN_INVENTORY.md`.
3. Created `.swimpay-agent/BUYER_CHECKOUT_UX_REPORT.md`.
4. Reworked hosted checkout into staged buyer screens:
   - Pay with SwimPay intro;
   - bank-first selection;
   - payment method reveal;
   - payer launcher;
   - card/phone instructions;
   - buyer-safe checkout states;
   - desktop QR handoff.
5. Added tests for bank-step privacy, card/phone masking, buyer status panels and safe wording.
6. Kept backend APIs, contracts, workers, payment decisions, webhooks, database and Android notification processing unchanged.

## Next Recommended Action

Run browser screenshot QA for `/checkout/:paymentSessionId` across:

1. small mobile viewport;
2. large mobile viewport;
3. tablet;
4. desktop.

Then do a small visual-only spacing/QR polish pass if screenshots reveal layout issues.

## Do Not Do

- Do not change checkout APIs or contracts during visual QA.
- Do not process real bank notifications.
- Do not enable auto-confirmation.
- Do not expose raw card/phone or raw notification text.
- Do not claim official bank confirmation.
